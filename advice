1. Setup your title like below. You want people to know what your goals are. Setup a bot so that the title updates the “[1111 tokens left]” every time someone tips.
People will like to see that they are helping your goal countdown.

♥ Lush ON! ♥ Tip to make me cum - Multi-Goal: 1st goal-naked, 2nd goal-cumshow [1111 tokens left] #18 #asian #young #bigboobs #new #teen #lovense #squirt #pvt

2. Remove the gifs every time someone tips. It creates too much spam and breaks up the yellow wall.

3. Maybe add the bot that adds the person's tip amount for the day next to their name. I've seen it in some rooms. It shows up like this:
sauce8 | 123 | my message here

People like to flex and will make them feel cool to show how much they've tipped for the day.
